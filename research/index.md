## Population and individual level foraging variation among Pygoscelis Penguins

<img src="/images/GEPE_white.jpg" alt="GEPE" width="200" height="200" align="left">
While the diets and foraging ecology of <i>Pygoscelis</i> penguins have been well studied
in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc region, many studies overlook diet and niche
variation among and within populations, as well as variation within individuals.
Quantifying the degree of niche variation and consistency at the population and individual
level has the potential to aid in determining a species population level response to
changes in food availability or other environmental change. My Master's research focuses
on answering these questions about <i>Pygoscelis</i> penguin foraging ecology through stable isotope analysis.
